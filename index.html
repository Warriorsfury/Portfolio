Inside is pretty much a "cheat sheet" kind of wiki for various things on the main server I played on. Mainly used by either myself, or friends. Nothing major about it, and infact it's one of the first few things i've done in web development.<br><br>It also contains the first thing i've fiddled with in Javascript/Jquery. One of the more difficult languages i've been learning. You will find various "sections" inside about chemistry, security, engineering, and laws. It is quite likely that i'll go in and touch it up a fair bit in the future.<br><br>No inspiration was used for the main development of the site. The only programs used to create it were purely Sublime Text. Nothing like Bootstrap or Wordpress was used either. Purely built from the ground up. The main reason as to why it was made was to help myself learn the different chemistry mixes to create them effectively and quickly. Soon after completing a baseline of what I wanted, I showed friends who also played the game, and they took a liking to it too and begun to use it to help themselves as well.</div>

            <h1>This is some stuff about me, and who I am</h1>
            <p>
                Who am I, and where am I from?<br><br>I'm James Havel and I currently live in Kittery Maine. I'm 19 years old and I work at a resturaunt close by to get myself some dosh to begin my adult life. I used to live in New Hampshire and was born in Massachusetts but started moving around age 7 to New Hampsire to find a new place to settle. And thus a spree of moving began, never staying in one place for usually more than one Christmas. After a fair amount of moving, from one house, to another house, to ANOTHER house, we settled in Maine and have been living here for close to 7-8 years if i'm correct. A wonderful state, it's quite beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                A little about myself<br><br>I currently live with family but work at a cozy little resturaunt with two of my friends to make some dosh. I play a lot of games pretty avidly (A day never goes by without at least an hour on a game) and have great fun with friends on them. A lot of Runescape, CS:GO, Overwatch, League of Legends, and various other small time games. I used to play a ton of CS:S with over 2,000 logged hours, along with what I would presume is over 5,000 hours on World of Warcraft.<br>After finishing highschool I went to college, but after my first semester, stopped going because the college I was going to couldn't teach me what I needed. So now I work and teach myself each day (except weekends of course).
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever i'm not at work, or playing games, i'm studying. Studying hard. Studying a lot. Studying because it's my future. I would like to become a full-stack developer far into the future, but i'm currently just working on front-end stuff at the moment with a little design on the side. But by design I mean mainly just how I make my websites look, nothing much else beside that. I have a ton of resources I learn from each day, and a ton more I need to go through. I'm confident i'll be able to get the job done.

            <h1>Everything I can do, and what i'm learning</h1>
            <p>So far this is all the different types of code, frameworks, and programs I usually use for each project. Should they be needed of course. Each day I learn more and more.</p>
